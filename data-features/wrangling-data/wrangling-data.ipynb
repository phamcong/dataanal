In fact, you might not even find a single sample free of missing data. Annoying as this is, simply ignoring missing data usually isn't an option, as it can wreck havoc if not handled properly during your analysis. If not accounted for, missing data might lead you to erroneous conclusions about your samples by resulting in incorrect sums and means, and even by skewing distributions.\n",

We've referenced a site detailing almost 40 such operations for you to further explore in the Dive Deeper section. However, some wrangling tasks require you look closer at your data. For instance, if you survey users with a series of 1-10 ranked questions, and a user enters all 5's or all 1's, chances are they were not being completely honest. Another example would be a user entering in January 1, 1970 as their birthdate since you required they enter in *something* but they did not want to disclose the information. In order to further improve the accuracy of your datasets, always be on the lookout for these sorts of issues."
